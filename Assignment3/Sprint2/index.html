        //for this sprint, I tried adding the speech function into the code but it was very challenging to make it work. I checked it over with a friend and everything seemed correct but it just kept showing errors. In the end I just decided to do a fun circle drawing screen using PoseNet as well as include sound as a second library. You can see the places where I attempted to include the speech library in which I commented out. I only decided to do 2 sprints for assignment 3 because it was just very hard to do what I actually wanted to do in the codes.
